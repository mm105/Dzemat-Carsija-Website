# About project

Basic website for local Islamic community, Čaršija - Kakanj, created as part of CS412 Web Application Development course at International University of Sarajevo. Since the aim of project was to create only frontend part of website, project doesn't include backend functionalities. Plan is to implement backend part and thus have fully developed website with all necessary functionalities. Frontend is implemented using ReactJS.
